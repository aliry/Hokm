# Hokm Game

Hokm, also spelled "Hokm" or "Hukam," is a popular card game in Iran and several other countries in the Middle East and South Asia. The game is typically played by four players in two teams of two, but it can also be played by three or five players. Hokm is a trick-taking game, and the objective is to win a majority of the tricks in each hand.

Here's a basic overview of how to play Hokm:
Setup:
Players: 4 players, paired into two teams sitting across from each other.
Deck: A standard 52-card deck is used.
Deal: Each player is dealt a hand of 13 cards. The deal rotates with each round.

## Game play

Choosing Hokm: The first dealer is chosen randomly. The dealer shuffles the cards, and the player to their right cuts the deck. The dealer then deals all the cards one by one to each player. The player who receives the first ace (starting from the dealer's right) becomes the "Hakem" for the round. The Hakem chooses the trump suit (called "Hokm") for that hand. The trump suit cards outrank all other suits for the duration of that hand.

Leading the First Trick: The player to the Hakem's right leads the first trick. Players must follow suit if they can. If they cannot follow suit, they may play a trump or discard a card from another suit.
Taking Tricks: The highest card of the suit led or the highest trump card takes the trick. The winner of a trick leads the next one.

## Scoring

### Winning the Game

The first team to win 7 tricks wins the hand. The game is typically played to a predetermined number of points, often 7 points. Each hand won by a team scores them 1 point.

### Special Rules

If the Hakem's team wins the first 7 tricks consecutively, they score a "Kap" (also called "court" or "cap"), which usually counts as 2 points. If the opposing team wins a trick after the first 6 consecutive tricks won by the Hakem's team, they prevent the Kap.
Variations: Some play with variations like "Shelem," where a player can declare they will win all the tricks and play alone against the other three players for extra points.

Hokm involves a significant amount of strategy, with players having to carefully manage their hands and remember which cards have been played. Teamwork and communication (usually through game play rather than talking) are also crucial to success.
